 ## A simple Breakout game made with Godot Engine

 This game was made to help me learn about the Godot Engine, so there are a lot of bugs and room for improvements. 
 In case you are interested here is some sugestions:

 - Improving the ball bounce mechanic when colliding with the player paddle  
 - Add powerups  
 - Add new levels
